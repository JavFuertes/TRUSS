# Bayesian optimization for truss structures

Aim: Use Bayesian optimization on a truss optimization benchmark from literature.  

# Project Overview
This repository houses the artifacts and documentation related to our project, which focuses on Bayesian Optimization. The key components of this repository include a Jupyter notebook containing the Bayesian Optimization implementation, project planning document, and the final presentation materials.

### Repo structure and contents
- Âè£Reading includes much of the reference literature which was used as benchmark [Kanarachos](1-s2.0-S0045794916302036-main.pdf): the optimisation method which is being compared to a machine learning solution.
- **pyJive**: a finite element code that can compute the natural frequencies of a given truss design, which can be treated as black box model for this project
- **truss_bridge**: a directory with input files for the case of the project, including a [notebook](truss_bridge/truss_bridge.ipynb) with a demonstration of how to interact with the finite element code

Investigation and reference results obtained with other optimization approaches, check this paper: [Kanarachos et al., 2017](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compstruc.2016.11.005)


## TRUSS notebook:
The Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the Bayesian optimiser and the posterior analysis. It covers a from blank implementation, a solution through Botorch module and analysis on the covergence. 

## Presentation_final
A small breakdown of the progress made in the project [TrussBOPT.pptx].
